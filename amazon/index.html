        <h3>
          In their 2008 SEC filing, Amazon describes the vision of their
          business as to:
        </h3>
        <p>
          ‚ÄúRelentlessly focus on customer experience by offering our customers
          low prices, convenience, and a wide selection of merchandise.‚Äù
        </p>

        <p>
          The vision is still to consider how the core Amazon marketing strategy
          value proposition is communicated both on-site and through offline
          communications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, achieving customer loyalty and repeat purchases has been
          key to Amazon‚Äôs success. Many dot-coms failed because they succeeded
          in achieving awareness, but not loyalty. Amazon achieved both. In
          their SEC filing they stress how they seek to achieve this. They say:
        </p>
        <p>
          "We work to earn repeat purchases by providing easy-to-use
          functionality, fast and reliable fulfillment, timely customer service,
          feature-rich content, and a trusted transaction environment.
        </p>

        <h3>Key features of Amazon include:</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Editorial and customer reviews.</li>
          <li>Manufacturer product information.</li>
          <li>
            Web pages tailored to individual preferences, such as
            recommendations and notifications.
          </li>
          <li>Secure payment systems.</li>
          <li>Image uploads.</li>
          <li>Searching on our websites as well as the Internet.</li>
          <li>
            Browsing and the ability to view selected interior pages and
            citations, and search the entire contents of many of the books we
            offer with our ‚ÄúLook Inside the Book‚Äù and ‚ÄúSearch Inside the Book‚Äù
            features.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The community of online customers also creates feature-rich content,
          including product reviews, online recommendation lists, wish lists,
          buying guides, and wedding and baby registries.
        </p>

        <p>
          In practice, as is the practice for many online retailers, the lowest
          prices are for the most popular products, with less popular products
          commanding higher prices and a greater margin for Amazon.
        </p>

        <p>
          Free shipping offers are used to encourage increase in basket size
          since customers have to spend over a certain amount to receive free
          shipping. The level at which free shipping is set is critical to
          profitability and Amazon has changed it as competition has changed and
          for promotional reasons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Amazon communicates the fulfillment promise in several ways including
          the presentation of the latest inventory availability information,
          delivery date estimates, and options for expedited delivery, as well
          as delivery shipment notifications and update facilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          This focus on customer has translated to excellence in service with
          the 2004 American Customer Satisfaction Index giving Amazon.com a
          score of 88 which was at the time, the highest customer satisfaction
          score ever recorded in any service industry, online or offline.
        </p>

        <p>
          Round (2004) notes that Amazon focuses on customer satisfaction
          metrics. Each site is closely monitored with standard service
          availability monitoring (for example, using Keynote or Mercury
          Interactive) site availability and download speed. Interestingly it
          also monitors per minute site revenue upper/lower bounds ‚Äì Round
          describes an alarm system rather like a power plant where if revenue
          on a site falls below $10,000 per minute, alarms go off! There are
          also internal performance service-level-agreements for web services
          where T% of the time, different pages must return in X seconds.
