        <p>
          Let‚Äôs talk about Flipkart‚Äôs broad marketing strategy. On the face of
          it, their main principle seems to be focused on being present at every
          single touch point their customers are present at. Today this means
          using the majority of their budget on digital channels and marketing.
          Moreover, since India is a mobile-first country, this is most
          definitely paying off. Flipkart also invests heavily in star power and
          influencer marketing. India loves Bollywood and Flipkart uses this to
          sell and raise awareness about their products. Ranbir Kapoor, Alia
          Bhatt, Amitabh Bachchan and Shraddha Kapoor have all been prominently
          featured in Flipkart TV ads and in their online campaigns. This shows
          that Flipkart not only has deep pockets, but also has an eye on the
          pulse of the market. In recent years, Flipkart has increased its
          budget spend on digital marketing considerably. Earlier, they were
          spending crores in multichannel marketing campaigns that resulted in a
          large amount of cashburn. Since Kalyan Krishnamurthy took over
          Flipkart in 2017, there has been a large-scale revamp of its marketing
          strategy - it‚Äôs become leaner and heavily based on digital, which has
          worked out well for them. A study published in Livemint in 2017
          outlines the very beginning of the transformation wherein potential
          customers showed a greater awareness of Flipkart‚Äôs Big Billion Day
          sale as compared to other retailers.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to marketing campaigns, Flipkart also uses its digital
          channels extensively to provide customers with the best experience
          possible with their platform. Customers voice concerns and complaints
          on Flipkart‚Äôs social media channels and this is dealt with quickly and
          efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, this investment in digital channels hasn‚Äôt stopped Flipkart
          from working with celebrities and influencers extensively. Flipkart
          relies heavily on influencer marketing and influencers to spread the
          word about their campaigns. The best part about this is that the
          message can be utilized both online and offline - making way for them
          to use it both for TV spots/billboards, as well as advertising online.
